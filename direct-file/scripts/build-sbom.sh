# This script will build a cyclonedx SBOM listing our application's dependencies.
# For more information on cyclonedx and SBOMs, check out https://cyclonedx.org/
# SBOMs will eventually be required for all federal projects per
# good ole OMB circular M-22-18. It's just a list of dependencies.
# https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/M-22-18.pdf
# Running the script will require that the df-client-app and backend have
# already installed their dependencies. Additionally, there's more work
# to get sboms for the status and submit applications.

# This script makes use of the cyclonedx cli, https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-cli.
# You can install it via `brew install cyclonedx/cyclonedx/cyclonedx-cli`

# Note: the analytics and data-import modules referenced by earlier versions of this
# script are not present in this repository (they are not part of the public release),
# so they are not generated or merged here.
